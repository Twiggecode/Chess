# Chess Game

This is my chess game that I developed using Java to improve and showcase my OOP skills. To play the game, download ONLY the ## Chess.jar file and open the file with OpenJDK Platform binary. An instruction menu will be displayed on the screen

Feel free to take a look at my code in the src folder.
